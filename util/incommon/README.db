For example, Incommon get the request, but the connection died before we got a response.
Symptom.  Cert in in the incommon manager, but not local

dn: from log or request
cn: from log or request
ca: 2=incommon
status: 1=issued
caid: (from manager: Self-Enrollment Certificate ID)
expires: (from manager: Expires)
renewid: (from getCert.py)
