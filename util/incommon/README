These are some scripts to manually access the incommon API---mostly for diagnostics.

They assume a password file: /data/local/etc/comodo.pw
which contains:

  <authData><customerLoginUri>InCommon</customerLoginUri><login>your_id</login><password>your_password</password></authData>


Note you need the vertual env from .. ( if this is from an ansible install )

getCertTypes.py

  lists authorized certificate types.
  this is handy way to verify the password is correct

getCert.py

  gets a certificate
  arg is the cert's Comodo's issuer id


getStatus.py

  gets the status of a request


test_pw.sh

  invokes getCertTypes.py in a convenient shell script
