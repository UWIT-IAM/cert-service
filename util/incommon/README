These are some scripts we use at the University of Washington to
manually access the incommon API---mostly for diagnostics.

They assume a password file: /data/local/etc/comodo.pw
which contains:

  <authData><customerLoginUri>InCommon</customerLoginUri><login>your_id</login><password>your_password</password></authData>

Our app for user cert requests is a java web application.  Thus no cert request here.

If you wanted to add one you might need another file:  /data/local/etc/comodo.os
containing:
  
  <orgId>your_org</orgId><secretKey>your_secret</secretKey>

and process it in a similar manner to the password file.
